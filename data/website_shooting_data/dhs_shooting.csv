Police told ABC7 they believed it began when a car pulled up to the front of the school  and someone inside started firing shots toward the school. Within minutes of the shooting  dozens of police cars and seven ambulances surrounded Dunbar High School. Witnesses say the shooting happened just before 8 p.m. outside the main entrance of the school. Police said no suspects had been arrested as of 8 a.m. Saturday. There was a crowd inside the school for a basketball game. When the shooting broke out  it led to chaos. Some witnesses believe gangs were involved in the shooting. Police say they're unsure whether something happened at the basketball game that may have sparked the violence. Dunbar was in an overtime game with John Hope College Prep. The paramedics transported five people  all young men  three of them code red at the time. All five were in stable condition Saturday morning. More than 200 officers are addressing this problem right now to make sure we've got some good leads going on. We're working closely with the Chicago Public Schools. We're reviewing cameras. We're reviewing any type of film we have to try and get possible leads on this

I recommend going up right before dark so you can see the city during daylight and at night. The sight is incredible. - take a cold bottle of water with you and make sure you use a restroom before you get in line - it took us nearly 2 hours to get up to the room. See More Melissa Morgan Lear · February 26  2017 Went to the top of the John Hancock Center and the views were phenomenal . As a person who throughly enjoys architectu re and design this experience was amazing. ... The bar was nice but was upset there was no Bloody Mary mix and the bartender wasn't very friendly. However  once served alcohol  who cares  right? I also decided to try TILT and what a unique experience. I highly recommend. The new branding and market appeal is quite catchy as well. Only downside is the signage to actually get to the top of the building after purchasing your tickets needs a bit of work. See More Brandon C. Terry · February 20  2017 Well worth the time and money. Had read reviews prior to our train ride from NY  and most were favorable. The staff was friendly  and the wait was tolerable. I ... would recommend this over the skydeck if you had to choose. Tilt is a great idea  and for the $7  it's an experience that is not only safe (it will scare most though)  but also forever memorable.

Lucas · November 26  2016 Taste of Chicago  is one of the Best Festival that Chicago has. It embodies family  friends  and visitors from across the globe. I have many many memories ... of good times with love ones(Cat  Anne. Wayne and Ralph) who have passed on. I have many many memories with my son who now shares his times at this marvelous fest with his son  and wife (New Yorker). The food is incredible  and the music venue is top notch! Can't wait for Taste of Chicago  2017! See More Fatima Diggs · July 8  2016 Well I came all the way from New Jersey and I loved it! I noticed the ones saying they didn't care for it seems to be the ones that has been there before so may ... be it's just old to you guys. It was new for me and my family and we enjoyed every bit of it! I'm originally from Philly and we don't have things like this and when do its not very orginazed or as clean as it was! I was very impressed and I'll be visiting again! See More Leon Que · April 1  2017 Good food and good people there! I have to get friends together so we can hit the road! Angelika Abramzik · July 7  2016 We try to go every year and drive over an hour to this. Not including the expensive parking. This year it left us very disappoint ed. The food choices were soo ... lacking that I was ashamed this is Chicago. This is supposed to represent local restaurants no?? Not music! What happened? Where are your proud displays?? Not even the Chinese had food truck there! 2 weeks ago I was at Taste of LONDON and it was night and day!! No comparison!! Wonderful chic restaurants and tastings  many cool restaurant & bar displays. Wish i could add pic to show difference. Hope no one from there comes to visit Taste of Chicago I say!! There was no variety whatsoever. Need to check out restaurant list next year to even consider coming back again. Ugh just sad See More Betsy Peterson-Ortolano · July 10  2016 I haven't been in years and like how it's expanded down Congress. The music was good at all the stages. Everything tried was from unknown vendors so I like th ... at ( I can get Malnatis or Giordanos down the street from me) and taste menus are nice for less expensive smaller items. Drinks are still ridiculous can buy water for a $1 from the guys on the street. See More Bryan Laughlin · July 10  2016 Chicago.

Yet when you show up to the largest outdoor festival in the city  y ... ou are shunned away when you arrive with your loving and caring pet. We allow protestors to storm out streets and festivals but God forbid you have a pet you're viewed as a pariah. Utterly disappointed in this city and the event organizers. Disgraceful. Time to grow up Chicago. So much for being a loving city See More Tavia Libra-Scalez Brown · June 23  2016 Always loved going to Chicago  but the Taste is always a treat for coming. I've learned to get to the grounds super early so that you can enjoy the festival. Otherwise  it does become a headache. And definitely get lots of tickets to try a bit of everything ! Susan P Spaeth · July 9  2016 The best gelato in the city is Cafe Gelato. So yummy & refreshing   it was a great dessert on such a nice night. Booth 36 at the taste this year. The Happy Lobster & Bruges brothers food trucks were yummy. The bacon on a stick at Bobeks was incredible as well. Karen Harding · March 29  2017 Love it  have not been since my husband passed 5 years ago but will be there this year! Juliana A. De Melendez · July 13  2015 It's getting worse and worse every year. Selection of restaurant s is much less comparing to even last year when it was already bad. Two hours before closing tim ... e a lot of vendors were out of most of their food. Seating area reduced from picnic tables with benches to barrel-like tables. Music was just... blah. They used to invite great artists like Carlos Santana  Donna Summer  Chaka Chan... not anymore. And what was that $2.50 surcharge on a strip of tickets for? After spending $85 for 2 people at The Taste we were  well  not full  went and got a $5 burrito on the way home. Ridiculous. Most likely we won't be going back anymore. See More Keith Carlson · July 9  2015 The City of Chicago bureaucrac y has found a way to ruin what should be a wonderful event. The over 20% markup on tickets is compounded by the fact that they als ... o charge the restaurants an additional over 20% in commission. The health department is on a crack since the hummus incident a few years back and makes it impossible for local vendors to provide fresh delicious food. From a vendor standpoint this is the worst festival ever experienced. It's a shame the city has turned this event into such a sham:( See More William J. Maroney · July 6  2016 Almost $5.00 for a bottled soft drink. Are you kidding me??????? Almost $5.70 for a very small piece of Lou Malnati's Cheese and Sausage which was rubbery  co ... ld and very greasy. WAY over-priced........WAY OVER-PRICED! TOC has become a total rip-off. Don't bother. Done with The Taste. Someone should lose their job over this. Have been going since it started and it sure has gown downhill. SO bummed. Don't waste your time or money. See More Mark Smith · July 7  2016 Been going to The Taste ever since its Inception. . love the food vendors and the people and the scenery especially going to the bean and Buckingham Fountain wha ... t a treat and a nice Rainbow Cone to top off the trip and a short trip to Lou Malnati's over on State Street to get a pizza a mini Chicago vacation it don't get no better than this See More Julius Riles · July 7  2016 The Taste of Chicago is an annual tradition  with top-billin g class acts  food  food  food  on the beautiful Lake Michigan lake front  and full of Chicago flavor. Christopher Kurek · July 9  2016 Not as many vendors as I remember the last time I went  but was definitely able to find some good eats today. My biggest gripe was the lack of properly labeled ... & sorted RECYCLING bins.. they have a great opportunity to set a precedent with recycling and they really dropped the ball this time. See More TaKeisha ReShea Mcclendon · July 12  2015 I thought it was ok. I had been dying to go. My bf is from Chicago so we took the kids to six flags and had adult time at the taste. Maybe I was too excited and ... it just didn't live up to my expectations! We spent $50 on tickets and was only able to sample a few restaurants a peice. I think I will skip it next year. Not worth the 5 hr drive from ohio. See More Elana Kritikos · July 11  2016 I've lived in the area all my life but this was my first time visiting the Taste of Chicago. PROS: Free entry; activities and music like at any town's festival ...   but higher end""; good variety of TASTY food; food prices were average or even slightly less than some other food festivals; Taste Portions let you try many different things; quick and efficient (at least from the hours of 11:45am-2pm on Sunday"

The salesman Dave Azizinamini was amazing  he knocked the price down on the guitar to beat another seller's price on Reverb(which is ran by CME for full disclosure) and threw in the gig bag at a great price  not mention helped my friend out with a little help on the price with his purchase as well. These guys love music and it shows from the millionaire rockstars that come through(seriously look at the pictures of who's been in there and try not to find an artist that hasn't touched your life) to the everyday person who's looking for a great guitar. Kudos to Dave and kudos to CME. I previously did business with them on an online order and now having been into their shop  I will definitely keep them in mind when searching for gear in the future. And if only to come back and just be awed by the antiques and one of a kind instruments that are hanging on the walls! See More Ace Comparato · February 9  2017 I can only review their online services since I've never visited the actual store. I placed an order for a pedal a week ago and it has still yet to ship. After ... 4 days I reached out to customer service and was told the delay was due to a switch in POS and shipping systems. The next day I was told the pedal would ship that day or the next. Well  both those days came and went and still...no shipping notification. I understand that technology can fail  it's happened to me at my job  but I could've ordered from a mail order catalog and had a faster turn around time. Customer service was pleasant  but whoever is in charge of shipping is really dropping the ball here. At this point  I'd rather just cancel my order and shop else where. This is my first experience with CME  but I doubt I'll ever order from them again. See More Joel Schroer · January 8  2017 OK.... First off... I am a lefty.

As many of you already know  I am a Nurse Practit ... ioner student; currently working on a Masters degree capstone project which will include the information gathered from a VERY short (2-3 minute) ten question survey. The intent is to reflect on the use of Point-Of-Care tools used by clinical care providers (MD  DO  and NP) in their daily primary care practice. If you are an MD  DO  NP or Student of one of these disciplines; and would give just a couple minutes of your valuable time to answer these questions. If you are NOT a provider but know any  please take a moment to tag them to this post or refer it on to them. My goal is to have at least a hundred replies before starting analysis in the next few weeks. My email is included in the survey and listed below if you have any questions or would be interested in the results  when the project is completed. Here is a link https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/C3956NH you can control/click on  or copy and paste to your browser. The survey is offered through Survey Monkey and secure  and it asks no personal information. It is completely confidential and anonymous by design. In order to gain enough sample responses  I ask you to follow the link and answer the ten questions; then PLEASE pass this survey request on to any friends or contacts who are also in practice or programs. Thank you in advance for your time and participation. As I am trying to reach as many providers as possible  feel free to share this post on your own page if you feel so inclined.

Other possibilities would be short cue spacing in which case one measures and runs the new reel even farther down to compensate  failure to start motor on time after seeing first cue  or mis-adjusted ramp up time on electronic motor controllers.

Lisa Brown-Abrams · January 11  2017 Whenever I shop at NEIMAN MARCUS it's such an amazing experience ... I love the atmosphere ... enjoy the experience ... and customer service is very friendly always.... Sally Root Bange · November 5  2016 Service is impeccable . George and Manny are both so great.

Quality Customer service. Best place to find the latest about fashion. Karen Tatomirovich · January 3  2016 After reading about what the restaurant in Dallas Tx.  did to a woman  I will never buy anything from them. She asked if she could have the recipe for the cooki ... es  the waitress said she could buy it for two fifty. When the woman got her Visa bill the following month  her bill said $250.00! Shame on you people for taking advantage of a customer! They would not refund her money and because they wouldn't  she shared it on Facebook. Ha! Ha! See More Dillon Kreider · November 19  2016 Anthony was very helpful and provided great insight on a purchase I made! This location's service is second to none. Takisha Walters · March 6  2017 Very pleasant and polite customer service! Friendly staff Cindy Timms · April 22  2015 I never thought I would ever write anything negative about NM after being a loyal customer myself for over 30 years but I have been treated in the most despicab ... le manner  to the point of making me feel like garbage by an ongoing situation that I thought was being handled by a Lorie Banks and by a Susanna Barnard. I was given many apologies and a good faith offer of $100 credit which turned out to be false  in actual fact  they lied to me  never stayed in contact and all their promises were empty ones. The items that I wanted to purchase are since been sold. I will never shop at NM again. They have clearly shown that they not only don't care but they do not value loyal customers. I'm horrified and am having a hard time coming to terms at the amount of time I wasted and the huge upset and stress that was placed upon me. No store is worth being a customer for that disgusting treatment and I will be letting social media do their magic to alert others.

Chicago: a Southern Exposure will feature my photography of black architects like John Moutoussamy and Ryder  Morrison and Margerum  as well as better known architects who did their thing there. The exhibit will also show the remarkable examples of architectural adaptive reuse by the South Side black folk who repurposed buildings long before it became hip. This show will be at the DuSable Museum. The second show will be called Elevation  and is a collaboration between architect Jim Gorski and me  looking at the architecture  topography and social/racial history of the Beverly neighborhood. It'll be at the Beverly Arts Center.

Thank you Alexis for caring about Chicago's youth. Alexis Murillo supporting Chicago Public Schools. · 17 hrs · GoFundMe · #supportCPS - SHARE THIS POST! When I reflect on all I have accomplished  I think about the experiences I endured while growing up in Chicago and being a produ...ct of CPS. If it was not for the incredible support from CPS  I would not be where I am today. After being a student in the CPS education system and a member of the CPS Student Advisory Council (SAC)  I learned that measuring a school district’s success or failure is not simple. There are often discussions and negative portrayals in the media about how CPS shapes education. When I was a member of the CPS SAC I always said that I wanted people to understand how lucky they are to have the opportunity to get an education  and show them why they should use it to their fullest advantage. I still want to continue to be a leader for students  and help make powerful changes. That is why this summer  I want to go home and give back to where I came from by directly advocating for CPS and providing Chicago youth with new opportunities. I know what it is like to feel underrepresented and I have a deep and sincere passion for serving the youth of Chicago. With all of that being said  I would deeply thank you from the bottom of my heart if you would donate any amount of your choosing to the children of Chicago. They need you. All of the proceeds are going directly to SocialWorks who is supporting Chicago Public Schools. Bless up. 🙏🏽 Thank you.

The service  food  and atmosphere were the best! We went on a Friday evening at 9 and our server was the best. She made suggestion s off of our picks and wasn't wrong all night. My boss recommende d it and it did not disappoint . We will be back and we'll tell friends. Lisa Dudek Packee · January 6  2017 I am a pretty picky eater and was a bit skeptical that I'd find a dish I would eat. We ordered 3 appetizers all of which were fabulous and my main course of steak and shrimp was amazing! Left full and satisfied. Can't wait to go back. Jada Diehls Ketel · March 25  2017 My husband and I are vegans and they accommodat ed us with a vegan menu. Wow. The food was incredible and the staff impeccable ! So friendly and focused on making sure we were very well taken care of. Great atmosphere ! Get the Cha Gio Chay appetizer! You won't be disappoint ed! Marc Dubey · September 26  2016 I don't think I've had better service ever  the food was subtle  I expect big flavors from my pho but there was nuance as well. The waiter overheard my daughte ... r has a nut allergy and promptly brought a special menu and explained it to her. I drink a lot of water  so my pet peeve is getting refills  I never had to ask once. The Creme Brûlée and Chocolate Mousse cake are with your weight in guilt about cheating on Jenny Craig or any other diet. I love my joints on Broadway but this is a complete package. See More Becca Renee · December 13  2016 I've been two times now  both times have been incredible . Service  atmosphere   food  and quality have been 10/ 10 both times. We were sat quickly  promptly taken care of  and felt very comfortable while enjoying a delicious meal. I'll be back again! ❤️ Kimberly Theis · October 22  2016 First time experienci ng Pho soup  and I believe I'm ruined for life. Not sure any other place could compare. We thoroughly enjoyed the tuna appetizer and a fil ... et entree (tomato rice pilaf is outstanding!) and the Chilean sea bass � Ambiance finishes everything off for the perfect intimate dining experience! Definitely recommend upstairs seating. See More Natassia Greene · December 27  2016 It was honestly rather mediocre. They were under staffed. It took a long time to get our often taken and the wait for our appetizers + soup was an hour. The sou ... p wasn't anything to write home about. It was a chicken soup with corn. It was water  corn starch  bland chicken  bits of corn  and cilantro. I would never recommend that to another person. The beef appetizer wrapped in rice noddles was great  though. See More Jacob Valenzuela · December 27  2016 Our second time in Chicago and second time here! We love the food ambiance and service. Glad to see you are in Houston - a short 3 hour drive from our hometown San Antonio. Kathryn Hempel · February 16  2017 We loved Le Colonial. Great atmosphere   excellent service and very accommodat ing for our table of 8  including a variety of vegetarian and vegan options as well. Hope to be back soon. Thank you! Tom Brassell · January 4  2017 Food was spectacula r  setting very intimate and our server Omar(spell ing) was the best a pure delight. Have desert!!!! Venjie Largoza · November 18  2016 The bouillabai sse! The bouillabai sse! Love the ambience  the service and oh the dishes! I always make it to Le Colonial when ever I am in Chicago! What's not to like? Brad Korris · February 10  2017 Very quaint old school neighborho od type atmosphere   fantastic food  solid price point  very attentive service. Lila Abuzir Zayas-Bazan · September 10  2016 Service was great!! Food was excellent. I ordered number 39. Beef and shrimp combo and it was great!!! Very flavorful and tender. Rice was sweet which I'm not used to but good. We shared 4 desserts that were so good!!! We will be back!! Michelle Burnside · March 12  2017 Very good food and great service. Will definitely come back when I come back to Chicago. Marisa Catalano · January 1  2017 We did the fixed price menu. Very very good food  but not really $75 a person good. Janet Z Capua · March 10  2017 Beautiful food  wonderful service  lovely venue. Had a exceptiona l dinner with family. The meal was perfect! Claudia Sunny · February 2  2017 I absolutely love their food! I've been dining for over 9 years and it's my favorite restaurant . Ken Dacey · October 24  2016 Everything was well prepared and so tasteful. Only drawback was the tables were crowded together and we were a foot from entrance. Kinda pricey but worth it Franki Parsons · October 21  2016 One of the best restaurant s I've ever been to in all my travels. The food  atmosphere and service always exceed expectatio ns.

No lines  no waiting  no crowds!! We basically had the whol ... e floor to ourselves. So I highly recommend those not wanting to pay any extra for the fast pass or city pass to go about an hour before close to avoid the lines. The city view was so amazing at night. See More Wendy Emmons · March 25  2017 We were told it would be a 1 1/2 hour wait but line seemed to move more quickly. Once we got inside to purchase tickets we asked if they had a military discount ... and my friend got in free since he is a veteran. There was plenty of room once you got to area to see views but you have to wait to go out on one of skydecks. Some were pretty rude and must have taken 50 selfies while people waited to have their turn. I understand you want some time but considering there were so many waiting perhaps they should put time limits on how long you can stay in skydeck. It was definitely a place to see while you are in Chicago. See More Tiffany Arriaga · February 21  2017 Definitely not worth the money to get in or for parking. $61 for 2 adults and 1 child. $38 for 2 hour parking. (It is a 1.5 hour bus and train ride to get there ... from where we live so we had to take the car.) It took me 42 years to finally go visit and I was very let down.😩 The most exciting part is the elevator ride up and to be able to experience being that high up....that's it. I've seen as these views in books/magazines/online. I thought seeing it for myself would be neat  but it wasn't. Oh and we waited in line for half an hour for the elevator to go down. I'm just being honest. Nothing like saying  is that it?"" for such an expensive event. See More Darla Johnson Baird · April 5"

Halsted and Fulton Stop. categories Dance & Night Club STORY Meet The Mid  located in Chicago‘s West Loop  it's in the middle of the city between Chicago‘s downtown and neighborhoods; somewhere in the middle of a live music venue and an upscale nightclub. The Mid is in tune with live music and nightlife to give music lovers the ultimate experience. The 801-person venue is located at 306 N. Halsted  with the marquee contrasting against the industrial lay of ... the meatpacking district  The Mid has already earned its seal of approval. Outside the doors of the club  the great views of the downtown skyline remind you of the wonderful city of Chicago. Inside The Mid  you will find four full service bars  ample room for dancing  cozy booths and table seating  and a second room equipped with its own bar and DJ booth. With a second floor balcony and seating  there is not a bad seat in the house. The dual-floor bathrooms are bigger than some apartments. Simple modern touches like exposed brick and dark wood floors make the place look rich yet relaxed. The stage is virtually a piece of art – the elevated stage boasts the electric-music below  and of course paired with a monster sound system separates The Mid from most. All of these elements keep with the venue’s direction to pave the way for music-centric clubs in Chicago. The Mid is brought to you by the good people who brought you this summer‘s freshest new music festival  North Coast Music Fest  and are responsible for the big names at The Congress Theater and Soundbar  among other venues in the city. With many big time artists already booked  The Mid will have music lovers lining up. Weekly parties; Freak Boutique  Mondays  Mayhem Fridays  Control Saturdays.

I do mean this from the bottom of my heart! :D Zach O'Malley · November 4  2015 Randomly helpful articles but for the most part its become a buzzfeed Chicago. Most articles are click bait  lists that are condescend ing and full of made up problems. I remain subscribed only for the random good food suggestion s or bar specials. Jordan Greenberg · February 24  2016 Always helpful to find spots in Chicago I wouldn't know about  I use to stick to my favorite places.

Lou Ghiraldi · April 20  2016 Just wanted to pass on some important informatio n to you. Chicago 50 at 51 is a movement to get Chicago to play at Super Bowl 51 next year. The recent HOF ind ... uctees will be celebrating their 50th anniversary in 2017 and what better way than to grace the biggest stage in the world. Since launching our efforts in February things are progressing well but we need to let even more people know. People should post on the Facebook pages of Pepsi  Bridgestone  and the NFL. Let them know that WE WANT CHICAGO TO PLAY AT THE SUPER BOWL. Our FB page : Chicago 50 at 51. Thanks See More Travis Nicholson · May 5  2015 Bring back the print edition!

Kathy Serrano · May 21  2015 A year ago today  Lincoln Park High School  LPHS  had my daughter wait in the office for medical attention while she was profusely bleeding from a Bullying atta ... ck which resulted in a fractured face/nose. If you are undecided what High School to place your 9th grade child Lincoln Park High School does NOT HAVE A MEDICAL PROTOCOL & in case your child is bullied and hurt your child will be on their own! Furthermore  Mr. Boraz  the principal  refused to help cover medical expenses. Although bullying incident took place on school premises. Lincoln Park High School is not against bullying and the Board of Education  CPS  hides all bully-related-incidents at all costs to continue to receive endorsements!

The venue was absolutely packed  to the point of not being able to walk onto the lawn. Staff screamed at you  got in your ... face  and blocked pictures trying to push the crowd further back on the lawn. There was no where to go. Yet staff just yelled at you and threatened to throw you out if you didn't move. There were multiple people passed out drunk on the ground. There was blood and puke on the ground. FGL put on a great show  but the staff ruined the experience. Doubt I will ever be back. See More Sam DeVellen · September 18  2016 First time ever being here and I will never be back. I went to the FGL concert on 9/17/ 16 and it was so unorganized. Took us almost two hours to get into the ga ... te. My friends and I missed Kane Brown AND the Cadallic Three. Alcohol line waits were crazy and not worth it. The staff kept pushing people back on the lawn and there were a lot of rude people. People were passed out and body fluids everywhere and the security was not secure at all. It was pretty much dog eat dog. You had to push your way through crowds to get where you needed to be. I loved the concert but did not like the venue. To get out of the venue was crazy long and we even left a little early. Just be warned  if you're going here  prepare for long lines  rude people  and rude staff. You need to be there super early so you're not waiting almost two hours. See More Laura Houtz · September 24  2016 I have been to many concerts here and never have I experience d the chaos of the FGL concert. My boyfriend surprised me with tickets for my birthday and we got t ... here when the gates opened to find traffic backed up for a half hour. We finally were parked and got to the front to find another line about 45 min long just to get our tickets scanned. After missing the 1st hour of the concert we headed in to find an amazing amount of belligerent drunks. I am all about having a good time  but this was beyond. The lines to use the bathrooms before FGL performed were half an hour at least. People were peeing  puking and passing out all over the place. Most disappointing and disgusting experience I have ever had.It was so bad we left early just to avoid being peed and puked on. We will never go back after that. Very disappointing and sad Hollywood Casino and Amphitheatre. See More Debbie Geboy Miller · September 19  2016 We had VIP seats so I had a great experience . I felt horrible for all those who didn't. The lines were horrendous ! I can only imagine how many people missed ... most of the event not only trying to enter the auditorium  but just to get in lines for beer and bathrooms looked absolutely horrible. When you hold an event with that many people you have to staff it! In addition the price for beer is ridiculous  $12.50! I know they have to make money some how but they don't need to rape the public. See More Sandy Strischek Mencarini · September 20  2016 We were there Saturday for FGL. The show was awesome!!! It was packed for sure. Even though they're cheaper I usually avoid the lawn cause it does get chaotic. ... Pit or seats for us. And to be honest when it's that crowded you have to go in knowing lines will be long or it will frustrate you. The staff we interacted with were all fine. No issues. And thank goodness for all the stalls in the women's restroom! The line moved very quickly! My only complaint is the prices of drinks. Absolutely ridiculous. Might get more but too much so we end up milking 1 to 2 at the most all night. Otherwise it was a good experience like always. See More Kellie Ryan · September 18  2016 I've been here several times. Lawn seats have bad sound unless you are as close to the bottom as possible. Also  $12.50 domestic beers is absolutely insane. ... You can get the same size beer at Wrigley for $10...and they deliver it to your seat. Tinley needs to tweak their prices. The last concert was at Florida Georgia Line (Sept 2016) On our way to the bathroom  my friend collapsed on the walkway and passed out (she was sober). I asked someone at the nearby food booth radio over to a medic. A woman showed up with a security shirt on and she just stood by us to keep other guests from trampling my friend (cuz we were in the middle of a walkway at a sold out show). We waited there for 15-20 mins  several guests stopped and brought us water and ice  but my friend kept going in and out of consciousness and was very pale. I got fed up and asked the security guard lady if a medic was on their way and she said that she didn't know cuz didn't have radio. WTF was she doing to help then??? Then security guard"" lady left to go help a girl that was puking so I begged a group of guys to help me carry my friend to the side on the walkway out of the crowd. Reluctantly I had to leave her alone on the grass while I ran to the nearest usher with a radio and begged for help. Finally one medic arrived"

Lots of happy people go there to just read  go on their laptops  read and hang out with friends. I went with my daughter and we sat by the fire ... and had a few drinks and dinner. It's a very beautiful place... I would say it made me think of what living at Hogwarts was for Harry Potter. Fun  very cool and cozy surroundings as well as a game room for chess and table shuffle board. With plent of bars thruout. a great place to just go and hangout and not even buy anything too! I was very surprised when I went. I'm glad my daughter shared this little gen with me. I'll be back! See More Jason Misicka · March 27  2017 What an amazing hotel. I truly felt as if I had traveled back in time. We spent several hours in both the game room as well as the drawing room. I've never stay ... ed anywhere with as much character and charm. The room was incredibly cozy and filled with character. My only complaint is that it was very warm in the room and we could not get it any cooler than 70 degrees. I will absolutely be returning to The Chicago Athletic Association Hotel in the future! See More David Mann · December 16  2016 My wife and I started our vacation staying with the fine staff of this exceptiona l establishm ent and we could immediatel y see we had made the right choice. From ... the first impression of the exterior to the greetings  amenities  and ultimately the room itself everything was a cut-above"". On our final night we experienced true customer service in the game room when a gentleman had enjoyed his experience a bit more than he should have and as a consideration for our understanding we were provided with a complimentary ""thank you"" from the management of the bar (Dave was his name) which was greatly appreciated and beyond our expectations. My only regret was not being able to stay until the Zombie Dust keg was tapped. I would recommend this hotel and overall experience to anyone looking for an authentic Chicago experience. Thank you to the entire staff of the Chicago Athletic Association"

Seventh Circuit Judge Richard Posner sees “absolutel y no value” in studying the U.S. Constituti on becaus ... e “eighteenth-century guys” couldn’t have possibly foreseen the culture and technology of today. In a recent op-ed for Slate  Judge Posner  a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School  argued that the original Constitution  the Bill of Rights  and the post–Civil War amendments “do not speak to today.” “I see absolutely no value to a judge of spending decades  years  months  weeks  day  hours  minutes  or seconds studying the Constitution  the history of its enactment  its amendments  and its implementation (across the centuries — well  just a little more than two centuries  and of course less for many of the amendments) ” he wrote. “Eighteenth-century guys  however smart  could not foresee the culture  technology  etc.  of the 21st century.” He added  “let’s not let the dead bury the living.” Judge Posner  an outspoken opponent of late Justice Antonin Scalia  also blasted “absurd” posthumous encomia for the late conservative. “I worry that law professors are too respectful of the Supreme Court  in part perhaps because they don’t want to spoil the chances of their students to obtain Supreme Court clerkships ” he wrote. “I think the Supreme Court is at a nadir. The justices are far too uniform in background  and I don’t think there are any real stars among them; the last real star  Robert Jackson  died more than 60 years ago. I regard the posthumous encomia for Scalia as absurd. Especially those of Harvard Law School Dean Martha Minow and Justice Elena Kagan.” David Bernstein  who teaches at Antonin Scalia Law School  formerly George Mason University School of Law  called Judge Posner’s swipe at Scalia “revolting.” “We all know Posner doesn’t think highly  to say the least  of Scalia. Judging from what Posner writes  the distaste seems to stem primarily from jealousy — Posner thinks he would be a far better Supreme Court Justice than Scalia was  and he resents that as a ‘lower court’ judge  his writings  though highly influential in their own right  will never get the same attention and accolades as Scalia ” Mr. Bernstein wrote.
