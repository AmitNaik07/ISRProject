Feb. 15 -- If there were lessons learned after the Virginia Tech massacre  they were: Lock down and notify. Virginia Tech officials did neither until hours after the first shots sounded across the Blacksburg campus in April. Northern Illinois University did not make the same mistake Thursday. But the university's actions still could not stop a man armed with powerful rapid-fire weapons and the intent to kill as many people as possible  higher-education and safety experts said Friday. The Virginia Tech killings  in which an emotionally disturbed student fatally shot 32 people  prompted soul-searching  safety reviews and the revamping of danger response plans at colleges and universities nationwide. Thursday's shootings at Northern Illinois provided the first test of one of those plans. By many preliminary accounts  the university did well: Within 30 seconds of a report of shots fired at Cole Hall  the first officer was on the scene. But he was too late. Stephen P. Kazmierczak  a former graduate student at the school  armed with a 12-gauge shotgun and three pistols  had already sprayed more than 50 rounds of buckshot and bullets at panicked students before turning one of his weapons on himself. Six people  including the shooter  were killed  and 16 were wounded. We were dealing with a disturbed individual who intended to do harm on this campus

Then  still on stage  he killed himself  authorities said. The gunman was not a current student at the school of more than 25 000 that rises from cornfields and subdivisions 65 miles west of downtown Chicago  authorities said. NIU President John G. Peters said the man had been enrolled as a sociology graduate student at NIU but left school last spring. Peters said the gunman had no police record. Late Thursday  sources confirmed that they have tentatively identified the shooter as a 27-year-old graduate student in social work at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. A law-enforcement source said the man was found with a U. of I. identification card in his pocket  but the identification has not been confirmed. Police also said they were unable to determine a motive for the shooting  which erupted shortly before 3 p.m.  about 15 minutes before the class of about 100 students in Cole Hall was scheduled to end. It was the worst campus shooting since April 16  2007  when 32 people were shot to death on the campus of Virginia Tech University by a student who later killed himself. Eyewitnesses described hearing a door to the right rear of the stage slam open and seeing the gunman  wearing a knit cap and sweat shirt  wielding a shotgun. He stayed within 10 feet of the door and started shooting—first with the shotgun and then with the handguns. He stood there for a second
