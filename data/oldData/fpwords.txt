This file is supposed to contain a list of tweets.
We will analyze those tweets for frequent patterns.
Based on the frequent patterns that are generated for a topic collection, we will select a top-k out of them.
Once we generate the top-k FPMs, we can generate features out of those based on the presence of those frequent patterns in the tweet.
